## IOT and ML based Cross Platform Application for Smart Parking System
The term parking management system usually refers to the custom built hardware intensive systems installed in buildings and malls.
We intend to build a cross platform smart parking system which aims to mitigate the parking problems by reducing time for drivers to look for vacancy positions in car parking lots and providing efficient parking space utilization.
This project focuses on developing a parking management system based on image processing to detect vacant parking slots in our college premises where automated systems are not installed.
